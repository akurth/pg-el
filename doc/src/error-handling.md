# Error handling

Errors signaled by PostgreSQL will be converted into an Emacs Lisp error that subclasses `pg-error`.
You can handle these errors as usual in Emacs Lisp, as shown in the example below. 

~~~admonish example title="Basic error handling"
```lisp
ELISP> (ignore-errors (pg-exec *pg* "SELECT ###"))
nil
ELISP> (condition-case nil
           (pg-exec *pg* "SELECT ###")
         (pg-error 42))
42 (#o52, #x2a, ?*)
```
~~~

Some errors are converted into specific subclasses of `pg-error`, as listed below. We can
discriminate the error category thanks to [PostgreSQL's SQLSTATE support](See
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/errcodes-appendix.html).

You can undertake error handling for specific error categories as shown in the example below:

~~~admonish example title="Differentiated error handling"
```lisp
ELISP> (condition-case nil
           (pg-exec *pg* "SELECT 2147483649::int4")
         (pg-numeric-value-out-of-range (message "Numeric overflow"))
	 (pg-syntax-error (message "Syntax error"))
	 (pg-error (message "Generic error")))
"Numeric overflow"
```
~~~


Please note that some semi-compatible PostgreSQL variants do not implement fine-grained SQLSTATE
error reporting, simply returning all errors as an “internal error” (this is the case of CrateDB in
2025-02, for example).
