This Emacs Lisp library lets you access the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) üêò
object-relational DBMS from Emacs, using its socket-level frontend/backend protocol. The library is
capable of automatic type coercions from a range of SQL types to the equivalent Emacs Lisp type.
This is a low level API, and won‚Äôt be useful to end users.

~~~admonish note title="Supported features"

- SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication (the default method since PostgreSQL version 14)

- MD5 authentication

- Encrypted (TLS) connections

- Support for the `SQL COPY` protocol to copy preformatted data to PostgreSQL from an Emacs buffer

- Asynchronous handling of LISTEN/NOTIFY notification messages from PostgreSQL, allowing the
  implementation of publish-subscribe type architectures (PostgreSQL as an ‚Äúevent broker‚Äù or
  ‚Äúmessage bus‚Äù and Emacs as event publisher and consumer).

- Parsing various PostgreSQL types including JSON, JSONB and HSTORE objects, array types, integer
  and numerical range types.

The code has been tested with PostgreSQL versions 16.1, 15.4, 13.8, 11.17, and 10.22 on Linux. It is
also tested via GitHub actions on MacOS and Microsoft Windows, using the PostgreSQL version which is
pre-installed in the virtual images (currently 14.8). This library also works against other
databases that implement the PostgreSQL wire protocol:

- [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach): tested with CockroachDB CCL v22.1.7. Note
  that this database does not implement the large object functionality, and its interpretation of
  SQL occasionally differs from that of PostgreSQL.

- [CrateDB](https://crate.io/): tested with version 5.0.1.

- [QuestDB](https://questdb.io/): tested against version 6.5.4

- [YugabyteDB](https://yugabyte.com/): tested against version 2.15

Tested with Emacs versions 29.1, 28.2, 27.2 and 26.3. Emacs versions older than 26.1 will not work
against a recent PostgreSQL version (whose default configuration requires SCRAM-SHA-256
authentication), because they don‚Äôt include the GnuTLS support which we use to calculate HMACs. They
may however work against a database set up to allow unauthenticated local connections. We mostly
test with Emacs on Linux, but it also works fine on Microsoft Windows and MacOS.

You may be interested in an alternative library [emacs-libpq](https://github.com/anse1/emacs-libpq)
that enables access to PostgreSQL from Emacs by binding to the libpq library.
