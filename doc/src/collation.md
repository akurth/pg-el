# Collation

Case support in PostgreSQL (`lower()` and `upper()` functions) depend on the current [collation
rules](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/collation.html). A table has a default collation
which is specified at creation (with a default). To remove the dependency on the
table's collation, you can specify the desired collation explicitly.

Note that PostgreSQL can be compiled with or without support for libicu, as a complement to the
collation support in your libc.

```lisp
ELISP> (let ((res (pg-exec *pg* "SELECT lower('F√î√ñ√â' COLLATE \"fr_FR\")")))
         (car (pg-result res :tuple 0)))
"f√¥√∂√©"
ELISP> (let ((res (pg-exec *pg* "SELECT lower('F√îüêòüí•bz' COLLATE \"fr_FR\")")))
         (car (pg-result res :tuple 0)))
"f√¥üêòüí•bz"
ELISP> (pg-result (pg-exec *pg* "CREATE COLLATION IF NOT EXISTS \"french\" (provider = icu, locale = 'fr_FR')") :status)
"CREATE COLLATION"
ELISP> (let ((res (pg-exec *pg* "SELECT lower('F√î√ñ√â' COLLATE \"french\")")))
         (car (pg-result res :tuple 0)))
"f√¥√∂√©"
```
